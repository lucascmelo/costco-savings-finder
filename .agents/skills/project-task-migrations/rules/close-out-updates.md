# close-out-updates: close-out updates only

## Intent
Limit modifications to completed work to preserve historical accuracy.

## When this applies

## Required
- On completion, only update checkboxes.
- Append discoveries/decisions as new lines.

3. For final outcomes, add to notes as new entries.
4. Never modify existing content text.

## Verification
- Only checkboxes have been updated.
- New content appears as appended lines.
- No existing text has been rewritten.
- Historical accuracy is preserved.
